# Limiting-Distributions-of-Conjugate-Algebraic-Integers-Applications

This is a repository to keep the polynomials mentioned in the Limiting Distributions of Conjugate Algebraic Integers paper by Bryce Orloski and Naser Sardari. There is a text file for each figure in the paper explained below:


real_serre_measure.txt: This file gives both the polynomial depicted in Figure 1 of the paper and the measure from which it was contructed.
lemniscate.txt:         This file contains the polynomial whose root distribution is depicted in Figure 2 of the paper.
uniform_annulus.txt:    This file gives both the random samples chosen and the resulting polynomial whose root distribution is portrayed in Figure 3 of the paper.
anti_jacobian.txt:      This file contains the polynomial which the paper suggests witnesses an abelian variety not isogenous to the Jacobian of any curve over F_9.
